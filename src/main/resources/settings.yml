  #How frequently (in ticks) should the plugin cycle to the next online player and refresh their scoreboard?
  #There are 20 ticks per second.
  #Low values will cost more performance. The default value, 5 ticks, is ideal for most community sizes.
  #If you have a ton of players online, you can decrease this value so players will see their scoreboard updated quicker.

#File version, do not change unless you have updated the config to such file version.

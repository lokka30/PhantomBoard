  #How frequently (in ticks) should the plugin refresh all scoreboards?
  #Lower value = refreshes faster, but costs more performance. 2 or below might cause flickering.
  #Higher value = refreshes slower, but costs far less performance.
  #If you are using placeholders that constantly update (e.g. player's health), you should use a lower value. Otherwise, going higher should be fine.
  #There are 20 ticks per second, so an updatePeriod of 4 ticks will refresh everyone's scoreboards 5 times per second.
  #The default value of 4 should be a good balance between refresh speed and performance.
  #Having a value too low (1, maybe 2) will cause the board to flicker.

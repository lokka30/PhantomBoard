# PhantomBoard
A simple PlaceholderAPI scoreboard plugin.

# Important Note
This project is discontinued. It's got a few bugs. There are plenty of other scoreboard plugins on SpigotMC that work perfectly fine, so I see no reason to maintain this resource.

I recommend InfiniteScoreboard (not open source but simplicity is key, slightly buggy) or AnimatedScoreboard (open source, lots of features if you need them, runs well) as a replacement.
